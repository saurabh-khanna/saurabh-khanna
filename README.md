I am an assistant professor of communication science at the [University of Amsterdam](https://ascor.uva.nl/), and a junior research fellow at Pembroke College, [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). My research is aimed at quantifying the limits of human knowledge in an increasingly digitized world. Some of my ongoing projects include:

- measuring diversity and incompleteness in information on the internet
- 'misinfotainment' and the blurring lines between political and entertainment communication
- studying inequalities in online occupation imagery and in entertainment media
- scientometric analyses of communication and media studies

I received my PhD in education policy (minor in computer science) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I was a Human-centered AI Fellow, a Stanford Data Science Scholar, and a William R and Sara Hart Kimball Fellow. My prior background spans computer science engineering (BITS Pilani), economics (Stanford), and education (TISS). More

I am fond of exploring unorthodox films from diverse cultures, cooking experiments, and playing sidekick to <a href="https://saurabh-khanna.github.io/assets/img/coffee.jpeg" style="color:#000000;" target="_blank">this angel</a>.
