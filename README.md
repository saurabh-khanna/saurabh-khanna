Hi there! 👋 

I am an Assistant Professor of Communication Science at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en/profile/k/h/s.khanna/s.khanna.html), and a Research Fellow at the [University of Oxford](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/person/dr-saurabh-khanna). I lead research on the diversity and limits of human knowledge at the [Invisible Information Lab](https://invisible.info/). I received my PhD in Education Policy [minor in Computer Science] from Stanford University, where I was a Human-centered AI Fellow, a Stanford Data Science Scholar, and a William R and Sara Hart Kimball Fellow. My prior background spans Computer Science Engineering [BITS Pilani], Economics [Stanford], and Education [TISS]. More <a href="https://saurabh-khanna.github.io/cv.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

I am fond of exploring unorthodox films from diverse cultures, plant-based cooking experiments, and playing sidekick to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/coffee_unfiltered/" target="_blank">this angel</a>.
