I am a Junior Research Fellow at Pembroke College, [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). My research is aimed at understanding (and quantifying) the limits of human knowledge in an increasingly digitized world. Some of my ongoing projects include:

- measuring 'incompleteness' in digital information and its implications for human behaviour
- 'misinfotainment' and the blurring lines between evidence and entertainment
- exploring inequalities by gender, ethnicity, and age in: i) online job imagery, and ii) entertainment media

I received my PhD in education policy (minor in computer science) from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/), where I was a Human-centered AI Fellow, a Stanford Data Science Scholar, and a William R and Sara Hart Kimball Fellow. My prior background spans computer science engineering (BITS Pilani), economics (Stanford), and education (TISS).

I am equally fond of exploring unorthodox films from diverse cultures, cooking experiments, and playing sidekick to <a href="https://saurabh-khanna.github.io/assets/img/coffee.jpeg" target="_blank">this angel</a>.
