Hi there! I am a PhD candidate in [education policy](https://cepa.stanford.edu/people/saurabh-khanna) (minoring in [computer science](https://cs.stanford.edu/)), a [human-centered AI fellow](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/introducing-stanford-hais-new-graduate-student-fellows), a [stanford data science scholar](https://datascience.stanford.edu/about/people/data-science-scholars), and a William R and Sara Hart Kimball Fellow at Stanford University. My background spans [computer science engineering](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/computerscience/ComputerScience) (BS@BITS Pilani), [economics](https://economics.stanford.edu/) (MA@Stanford), and [education](https://tiss.edu/) (MA@TISS). 

I study the diversity of information on the internet and its implications for open scientific inquiry. In current times of accelerating information overload, I estimate (in)completeness in information consumed by humans on the internet. I then build on these estimates to study the implications of consuming incomplete information on human behavior (such as our openness to dissent). In this regard, I am building [Sonder](https://github.com/sonder-labs/sonder) â€“ an open-source web search platform that dynamically quantifies how much information we miss out on with every search query. My interests around information diversity and open science extend to recent work on information warfare during the Russo-Ukrainian War with [Prof Alex Pentland](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=P4nfoKYAAAAJ) and [Prof Erik Brynjolfsson](https://www.brynjolfsson.com/) at the MIT Media Lab and the Stanford Digital Economy Lab, as well as investigating an under-representation of Global South research in mainstream scientometric indexes with the Public Knowledge Project.

Another aspect of my research is focused on social and economic networks and their interplay with human development indicators in the context of developing nations. I am actively working with [Prof Prashant Loyalka](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/loyalka) on investigating segregation in college (by affirmative action categories) in both student-student and faculty-student social networks, and with [Prof Susan Athey](https://athey.people.stanford.edu/) on tackling misinformation and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the developing world. More on these and other current projects [here](https://saurabh-khanna.github.io/projects/).

I am equally fond of exploring unorthodox films from diverse cultures, evening chai breaks, and playing sidekick to <a href="/assets/img/coffee.jpeg" target="_blank">this angel</a>.
